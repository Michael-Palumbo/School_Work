The program can be given a PS file, and use said instructions to contruct a PBM image. the program will read the PS ignoring everything until it reaches %%%BEGIN. It will then read all the instuctions and ignore everything after %%%END, empty newlines will be ignored in the instructions. The program can also take arguments, transforming the size, scale, and rotation. and allows you to offset the viewing window.

The program is written in C, on my windows computer. But is compiled in a linux emulator using gcc. 

There is only one C program, called CG_hw1, which contains the main method and everything else. I should have used headers, but that's something i'll resolve next assignment.

To compile my program, simply type 'make'
This will compile the program and the executable will be CG_hw1

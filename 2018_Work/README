Here lies some of my work I made during the beginning of my freshman year of college. These were just little side projects, most of my school work during freshman year will be found in the Uni section

- Simple Snake Game
 - Side project to teach myself canvas

- C_Language
  - I read the C programming language book, here are some of my tests when learning the C programming language, most tests are examples from the book.

# Advent Of Code

2018 - Python
2020 - C++
2021 - Rust

## Notes:

Please do not take my code here as an example of my coding abilities, AOC problems are the first problems I use when learning a language, **So I am often learning as a go**

Since I often use the AOC set to learn new programming languages, all are incomplete since I stopped when I got a good enough grasp that I was happy with, or because I because distracted with projects.

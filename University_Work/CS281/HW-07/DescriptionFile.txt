Assignment: 	HW-07


This is the answers to the hw7. Where we went of over the datapath, and what we are looking at and how we could change it.

I wrote this on a windows os computer. Any pdf viewer will beable to view the program.

No executable program, and no testing 

These description files are just so weird for assignments like these.

I think the assignment was nice, I just didn't like the beginning bit, 4.7 was weird. and I just didn't really understand what 4.1 was asking.

The later half was pretty interesting though, and its cool to see how we can change and make improvements.
